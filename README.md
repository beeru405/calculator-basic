### sonarqube quality gate condition in Calculator.java
In this modified version, I've added a method ```thisMethodIsTooLongAndShouldFailSonarQubeAnalysis``` that contains a loop that will print a message 1000 times. This method will trigger SonarQube to flag it as a code smell due to its excessive length.
